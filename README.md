# react-sync-ui

`react-sync-ui` enable to do the sequential synchronous workflow with usage of React Components.

## usage example

```tsx
<button
  onClick={async () => {
    // call synchronous UI workflow with promisified React components
    const name = await syncPrompt("Fill your name");

    while ((await syncPrompt(`Fill your password!`)) !== "1234") {
      await syncAlert("Invalid password, keep trying");
    }

    await syncAlert(`Congratulation Mr. ${name}, you are logged in`);
  }}
>
  Login
</button>
```

Library provides simple `makeSyncUI<InputData, ResolveValue>` function which can transform your declarative React Components
into the promisified callable functions.

```tsx
// defining of your custom react-sync-ui component
export const syncAlert = makeSyncUI<string, void>((props) => (
  <Modal isOpen toggle={() => props.resolve()}>
    <ModalHeader>{props.data}</ModalHeader>
    <ModalFooter>
      <Button onClick={() => props.resolve()}>OK</Button>
    </ModalFooter>
  </Modal>
);
```

## what problem is `react-sync-ui` solving?

For a long time, I did not like that React's functional way of declarative UI forced you to write nice UI code, but with ugly distributed business logic.
When you have a complex business use case which is a composition of asynchronous actions like HTTP requests together with user interactions,
your business logic code is distributed over many async React handlers and it's really hard to understand the sequence of operations and what is going on.

People very often solve this problem by dependencies in the `useEffect(..., [dependency])` which transfer react logic to the event-driven architecture.
When you change the variable value, the different components will register the dependency change inside of `useEffect`, and some other code is called.
With this event-driven programming, your code complexity is at least 1000 times more complex, and your newcomers who see the code have no idea what the business workflow is.

A nice solution for this problem is to wrap your declarative React components into Promise wrappers which split your UIs into many
smaller functions that can be simply composed together inside of your Javascript function and you'll get very complex business logic in just a few lines of code.

Thanks to `react-sync-ui` you may implement just your custom UI and don't have to care about the implementation detail of promise wrapping.

And that's why `react-sync-ui` was created. ‚ù§

## Installation

```bash
npm i react-sync-ui
```

## Usage

### Setup `<SyncUI />` Component into the root of yout project

```tsx
import { SyncUI } from 'react-sync-ui'

const App = () => (
  <>
    <SyncUI />
    <YourAppStuffs />
  <>
)

const root = createRoot(document.getElementById('root')!);
root.render(<App />);

```

### create sync UI

Now, you just have to define your custom React component which will be promisifed by `makeSyncUI` function.

`makeSyncUI` returns Promise which render your custom React Component.
Promise will be resolve when you call `props.resolve(any)` inside of your custom UI.

#### Alert example

```tsx
import { Button, Modal, ModalBody, ModalFooter, ModalHeader } from "reactstrap";
import { makeSyncUI } from "react-sync-ui";

export const syncAlert = makeSyncUI<string, void>((props) => (
  <Modal isOpen={true} toggle={() => props.resolve()}>
    <ModalHeader>{props.data}</ModalHeader>
    <ModalFooter>
      <Button onClick={() => props.resolve()}>OK</Button>
    </ModalFooter>
  </Modal>
);


// usage:

<button
  onClick={async () => {
    await syncAlert("Wait for it...");
    await syncAlert("Wait for it...");
    await syncAlert("You're hacked");
  }}
>
  click to me
</button>;

```

#### Prompt example

```tsx
import { Button, Modal, ModalBody, ModalFooter } from "reactstrap";
import { makeSyncUI } from "react-sync-ui";

export const syncPrompt = makeSyncUI<string, string>((props) => {
  const [input, setInput] = React.useState("");

  return (
    <Modal
      toggle={() => props.reject(new Error("User forced close prompt modal"))}
      isOpen={true}
    >
      <form
        onSubmit={(e) => {
          e.preventDefault();
          setInput("");
          props.resolve(input);
        }}
      >
        <ModalBody>
          <label>
            {props.data}
            <input
              value={input}
              onChange={(e) => setInput(e.target.value)}
              type="text"
            />
          </label>
        </ModalBody>

        <ModalFooter>
          <Button type="submit">Accept</Button>
        </ModalFooter>
      </form>
    </Modal>
  );
});

// usage:

<button
  onClick={async () => {
    const usersFeelings = await syncPrompt("how are you");
  }}
>
  click to me
</button>;
```

#### Confirm example

```tsx
import { Button, Modal, ModalBody, ModalFooter, ModalHeader } from "reactstrap";
import { makeSyncUI } from "react-sync-ui";

export const syncConfirm = makeSyncUI<
  {
    title: string;
    description?: string;
    okBtn?: string;
    notOkBtn?: string;
  },
  boolean
>((props) => (
  <Modal isOpen={true} toggle={() => props.resolve(false)}>
    <ModalHeader>{props.data.title}</ModalHeader>

    <ModalBody>{props.data.description}</ModalBody>

    <ModalFooter>
      <Button autoFocus onClick={() => props.resolve(true)}>
        {props.data.okBtn ?? "Yes"}
      </Button>
      <Button onClick={() => props.resolve(false)}>
        {props.data.notOkBtn ?? "No"}
      </Button>
    </ModalFooter>
  </Modal>
));

// usage:

<button
  onClick={async () => {
    const isOk = await syncConfirm({
      title: "How are you",
      okBtn: "Good",
      notOkBtn: "Not good",
    });
  }}
>
  click to me
</button>;
```
